      <h2>Hey! I'm Zach</h2>
      <p>I'm currently 25 years old, working as an Assistant Store Manager at Midas Auto in Minnetonka.
        I've always had a love for creating new things and challenging myself and I've felt like I could never get that out of a management position at an autoshop.
        Through the years that I've worked in this sort of position, my eyes have been opened to how much fun it can be to work as a team with a group of intelligent individuals.
        Everyone who I've spent time with in the last 5 years of my life has significantly impacted my outlook on my future and made me realize how much potential and time I have left at 25 even though
        I feel like im already on my death bed. I've decided to make a change and do something that challenges me more, makes me think, and also makes me get in touch with my creative side which is something I've
        been lacking. I'm extremely excited about how this project is going to turn out when im done at Prime, hopefully I can use a modified version of this page as a resume at some point.</p>

        <h2>99 Strength</h2>
        <p>One of my achievements in runescape was 99 strength I thought it'd be funny to put it in this section. It took quite a lot of time, but not much skill, I'm glad im never gonna train that ever again.</p>

        <h2>Cars</h2>
        <p>
        I've been in the automotive industry since the age of 17 and learned quite a bit about the workings of cars, everything from head gaskets (I have a WRX STI if anyone can relate)
        to transmission work and more.

        <h2>Bass</h2>
        <p>
        Though not practiced in awhile, I used to be in a band and we'd play shows all over Minnesota, I loved it and still am very passionate about music.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I went to school in the Edina school district, completing my highest
      education with a diploma from Edina Highschool. I went to Normandale Community College for about a year as I didn't know what I wanted to major in and due to this felt as though I was never
      full committed, it still is to this day one of the biggest regrets I have in life. I've always been worried that in the professional world I would never be taken seriously given my lack of a 4 year degree or similar. Unfortunately with
      my current position in life I don't have the finances to afford full time school for 4 years and balance that with owning a house. With Prime Academy under my belt I'm hoping to open doors
      to jobs and positions I would have never thought possible in the past and get a fresh start and outlook on life. </p>
